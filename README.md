LARI is an AI agent to play a card game similar to spades.
To implement LARI we used Monte Carlo Tree Search approach combined with a simple rule based agent. In other words LARI is a combination of Monte Carlo Tree Search and rule based system.

To run the program, clone the repo, and run the following 
`python run.py 1`
